## About

I am a quantitative political scientist whose research interests span **political sociology**, **comparative politics**, and **behavioural science**. My work focuses on LGBTQ+ politics, social and political identities, far-right parties and voters, and elections and campaigns.

As a **first-generation student**, I am committed to mentoring and supporting researchers from similar backgrounds. I am also an advocate for **mental health awareness in academia**.

## Current Research

My forthcoming book, **[The Rainbow Vote](https://press.princeton.edu/)**, is under contract with Princeton University Press and is supported by Leverhulme Trust funding. The project examines the political behavior and attitudes of LGBTQ+ voters across multiple countries.

## Research Highlights

My research has been published in leading journals including the *American Political Science Review*, *British Journal of Political Science*, *Journal of Politics*, *European Journal of Political Research*, and *Political Science Research & Methods*.
